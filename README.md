# Holiday Sales Scraper

Essentially, just fill emails.txt emails of your customers (separated by a newline), and it will send them the holiday deals of the day.

When the program is run, it will scrape certain sites for holiday deals, and then place information about those deals in a (local) SQL server, as well as to a python program that formats emails. These emails are then sent via a localized gmail server to all of the emails in the txt file. Simple.
